## PowerBI Report

This Workbook does not replace the need to setup an organizational view to visualize cloud costs. My coworker Chris has created an amazing PowerBI report which can be imported to quick start viewing this data in PowerBI: [PBX Report](https://github.com/chris-bowman/Azure-Cost-Reporting/tree/main/Power%20BI%20Report).

## Workbook Requirements

To use this Workbook you will need Read Only access to the resources you're investigating in Azure. But to save the Workbook you need permissions to create an Azure Workbook.

To see AKS information you need to leverage Container Insights.

> **Recommendation**: Read only access over the entire subscription / management groups will light up all the panels of the Workbook.

1. Copy the content from the file `workbook.json`.
